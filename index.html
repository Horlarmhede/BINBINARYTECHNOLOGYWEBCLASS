                                <p>After the sunset prayer, Muslims gather in their homes or mosques to break
                                     their fast with a meal called ifṭār that is often shared with friends and
                                      extended family. The ifṭār usually begins with dates, as was the custom 
                                      of Muhammad, or apricots and water or sweetened milk. 
                                      There are additional prayers offered at night called the tawarīḥ prayers,
                                       preferably performed in congregation at the mosque.
                                        During these prayers, the entire Qurʾān may be recited over the course
                                        of the month of Ramadan. To accommodate such acts of worship in the 
                                        evening, work hours are adjusted during the day and sometimes reduced 
                                        in some Muslim-majority countries. The Qurʾān indicates that eating
                                        and drinking are permissible only until the “white thread of light 
                                        becomes distinguishable from the dark thread of night at dawn.” 
                                        Thus, Muslims in some communities sound drums or ring bells in the
                                        predawn hours to remind others that it is time for the meal before
                                        dawn, called the suḥūr.
